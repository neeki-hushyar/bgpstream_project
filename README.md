# BGPStream

In this project we will use BGPStream to identify cases in which a entity has corrupted routing tables by adveritising false routes. In this case, two or more autonomous systems would be announcing the same IP address as their own. 

## Resources

BGPStream contains measurement data from the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). We will automate a program which will analyze historical data in search of conflicts. We will take into consideration, cases in which two automous systems advertise the same IP address at different times, which would not conflict. We will identify any disruptions caused by malciious or accidental conflicting network advertisements. 

## Outcome 

A case of multiple automous systems announcing the same IP address can happen as a result of malcious actions or genuine mistakes. We will identify these and other possible reasons for this corruption.
