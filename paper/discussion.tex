 \section{Prevention}\label{sec:prevention}
 
 There are several suggested methods for BGP hijacking prevention. The simplest prevention method would be to only allow updates from the autonomous system which previously announced the path for a specific entity. This, however may negatively affect the availability and reachability of the end system. A compromise which increases the security of the update while maintaining availability, would be to delay the adoption of an update which originates from an unexpected AS. In order for this method to be implemented, the AS and AS-level edges which normally announce each BGP path, or blocks of paths, may need to be white listed in some sense. BGP updates would have to be monitored and processed. This mechanism allows time for an accidental update be removed before having widespread, if any affect. 
 
An inactive implementation of such system, is the Inernet Alert Registry (IAR). The IAR  maintained routing security information based on route history. Route history determined BGP prefix ownership and an alert was raised if an update pointed back to a different prefix. A danger of this implementation is that a trusted AS-level edge for a given prefix will not be flagged in the case it makes a false announcement. Further, in the case of the Pakistan hijack, the falsely announced route would not have been flagged as the specific prefix announced would have still been in the valid prefix space. The following mechanism would catch the previously mentioned updates which would avoid detection by the IAR.

The mechanism proposed in [...cite], creates a system to flag and alert prefix owners to any update which changes the origin. Further, sending alerts for every update has high overhead on both the monitor and on the BGP prefix owner.  

All the above prevention and detection mechanisms rely on data pooled from monitors, route server and registries. This data is not comprehensive of all BGP routes and prefixes on the internet and can only prevent/detect attacks which it can map a route for.
